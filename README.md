# Quanto PWA

The classic but long discontinued Natara Quanto for Palm OS remade into a React Progressive Web App for modern mobile devices.

- Show your boss why it's hard to get work done on that project.
- With your crazy schedule are you getting enough sleep?
- How is your balance of work and family?

PWA Quanto is a time measurement tool that can help you improve your productivity or life balance by analyzing how you spend your time.

## Usage

For more info on usage, please check out [this manual!](https://seanlee.netlify.com/portfolio/pwa-quanto)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

If you wish to make commits and push the code up after cloning this repo, you should fork the project first. In order to own your own copy of this repository, you have to fork it so you get your own copy on your own profile!

You can see the fork button in the top right corner of every GitHub project; click it and a copy of the project will be added to your GitHub profile under the same name as the original project.

After forking the project, simply clone it the way you would from the new forked project in your own GitHub repository and you can commit and push to it freely!

### Installing

In your terminal after you clone your project down, remember to run either `yarn` or `npm install` to build all the dependencies in the project.

## Running the tests

Run `npm test`

Current coverage only >20%, more will be added soon.

## Deployment

`firebase deploy`
